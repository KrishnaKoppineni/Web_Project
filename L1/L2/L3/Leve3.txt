The kernel internally determines how much CPU time a process is allowed to
consume
´ The administrator can set this value manfully. It is called the nice value. It ranges
from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority)
´ By default, the child process inherits its parent’s nice value
´ A normal user can use the renice command to lower the priority of his own
process (positive value). But he cannot use it to increase it’s priority even to it’s
original value. The superuser can place any nice value on any process on the
system.
